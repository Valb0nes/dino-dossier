                <p>
                    After four expeditions the entire team had found about 145 bones and
                    one singular tooth. These 145 bones included 112 from a bigger
                    Dreadnoughtus and about 30 bones from a smaller second
                    Dreadnoughtus. In all of those bones most of the vertebrae has been
                    found which includes the tail, the neck, the scapula, multiple ribs,
                    part of the jaw, a couple toes, and a claw. The entire skeleton is
                    only about 45.3% completed and that includes the skull.

                    Their weight could differ from about 22 tons to 59 tons. Those
                    different weights come from when they are adolescent to full grown
                    adults. Their weight was compared to that of a dozen African
                    Elephants put together. Their height can be between 26m long to 2
                    stories tall between adolescent and adult. They were considered to
                    be one of the largest and heaviest dinosaurs in their time.

                    When they would breed the females
                    would huddle together in very large
                    groups wherever they decided to lay
                    their eggs. This would help prevent
                    anything from trying to steal their 
                    eggs. The males when they battle for
                    mating rights it is always a death 
                    match for whoever the loser is. They
                    also have sacks on their necks that
                    they use to attract a mate. These 
                    sacks were there so that the males
                    looked more appealing for the females
                    even though the male would have to 
                    battle between other males for the
                    winnings.

                <p>
                    Dreadnoughtus have these sacks on their necks that are bright orange
                    and filled with air. They are predicted to use these sacks for
                    communication and mating purposes. These sacks run all along their
                    necks. Other than those sacks nothing else is known about how the
                    Dreadnoughtus communicated with each other.

                <p>
                    The Dreadnoughtus lived in the Champanian/ maastrichtian of the
                    cretaceous. In this time period many of the other dinosaurs lived
                    too. This period was when most of the dinosaurs we know today have
                    lived. This time period included many different plants that the
                    dinosaurs fed on that are now extinct today.

                <h2>Behaviors and Adaptions</h2>
                <p>
                    The Dreadnoughtus were always in groups kinda like elephants now.
                    Paleontologists say that they were thought to have most of the same
                    behavioral patterns as elephants . They weren’t aggressive
                    creatures at all. Some of their adaptations were really cool and
                    that included how most of their bones were filled with it. Their
                    bones were really large and usually hollowed out with air inside
                    them. This was because the bones had to adapt to how heavy the
                    Dreadnoughtus were.

                <p>
                    Kenneth Lacovara discovered the Dreadnoughtus. He discovered the
                    Dreadnoughtus in February in 2005. This was a massive discovery
                    considering how just found another dinosaur. Kenneth was so excited
                    to have found a new species of dinosaur that nobody knows anything
                    about. He did many exhibitions to find more of the bones so that he
                    could do more research on the animal and get to know more things
                    about it before anyone else.

                <h2>Life History Cycle</h2>
                <p>
                    They first begin their life in an egg and hatching out of the said
                    egg. Once they are born they are susceptible to predators because
                    they are still really small. But as they grow they are less
                    susceptible to predators since they are getting bigger and aren’t
                    very small anymore. Once they reach full grown they have no more
                    predators at all since they are so big. Their full lifespan was 50
                    to 100 years and they became full size in roughly 20-30 years. So
                    they still had many years to live after that.

            <p>
                The dreadnoughtus sisn't really have any predators to note because of
                their size. But when they are first born and small they are more
                susceptible to having predators to protect themselves from. The one
                other time they could have a predators was when they died. The only
                predators they had then were theropods which were smaller predators
                and scavenger dinosaurs. Those were the only few predators that the
                Dreadnoughtus had in all of its life.

                they are more susceptible to having predators to protect themselves
                from. The one other time they could have a predator was when they

            <p>
                The Dreadnoughtus lived in mainly South America before pangea split
                up. The area in south america where they lived was in Argentina.
                Argentina was filled with forests and lakes which was a perfect
                environment for Dreadnoughtus dinosaurs. This was about the only place
                known today that the Dreadnoughtus fossils have been found in.

            <summary>Feeding and Diet</summary>
            <p>
                They ate all plants since they were herbivores. And Because they lived
                in forests and around lakes they had all the food they could eat
                there. Even Though they all lived in herds they still had plenty of
                food to go around. Since no other dinosaurs ever challenged them for
                their food, since they were so large and so many of them. The plants
                that these Dreadnoughtus usually lived off of were ferns, leaves, and
                conifers. These were their main source of food since they could reach
                really high with their necks; nothing was off limits to them.
