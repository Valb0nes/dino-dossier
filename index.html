           <h2>Fossil information</h2>
        <p>After four expeditions the entire 
         team had found about 145 bones and
         one singular tooth. These 145 bones
         included 112 from a bigger
         Dreadnoughtus and about 30 bones
         from a smaller second Dreadnoughtus.
         In all of those bones most of the
         vertebrae has been found which
         includes the tail, the neck, the
         scapula, multiple ribs, part of 
         the jaw, a couple toes, and a claw. The
         entire skeleton is only about 45.3% completed
         and that includes the skull.</p>

            <h2>Size Range</h2>
            <p>Their weight could differ from about
                 22 tons to 59 tons. Those different
                 weights come from when they are 
                 adolescent to full grown adults.
                 Their weight was compared to that of
                 a dozen African Elephants put 
                 together. Their height can be between
                 26m long to 2 stories tall between
                 adolescent and adult. They were 
                 considered to be one of the largest 
                 and heaviest dinosaurs in their 
                 time. </p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Breeding Behaviors</h2>
            <p>When they would breed the females<br>
                 would huddle together in very large<br> 
                 groups wherever they decided to lay<br>
                 their eggs. This would help prevent<br>
                 anything from trying to steal their <br>
                 eggs. The males when they battle for<br>
                 mating rights it’s always a death <br>
                 match for whoever the loser is. They<br>
                 also have sacks on their necks that<br> 
                 they use to attract a mate. These <br>
                 sacks were there so that the males<br> 
                 looked more appealing for the females<br>
                 even though the male would have to <br>
                 battle between other males for the<br>
                 winnings.</p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>Dreadnoughtus have these sacks on 
                their necks that are bright orange
                 and filled with air. They are 
                 predicted to use these sacks for 
                 communication and mating purposes.
                 These sacks run all along their 
                 necks. Other than those sacks nothing
                  else is known about how the Dreadnoughtus communicated with each other.</p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Time period</h2>
            <p>The Dreadnoughtus lived in the Champanian/ maastrichtian of the cretaceous. In this time period many of the other dinosaurs lived too. This period was when most of the dinosaurs we know today have lived. This time period included many different plants that the dinosaurs fed on that are now extinct today. </p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Behaviors and Adaptions</h2>
            <p>The Dreadnoughtus were always in groups kinda like elephants now. Paleontologists say that they were thought to have most of the same behavioral patterns as elephants =. They weren’t aggressive creatures at all. Some of their adaptations were really cool and that included how most of their bones were filled with it. Their bones were really large and usually hollowed out with air inside them. This was because the bones had to adapt to how heavy the Dreadnoughtus were. </p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Who Discovered it</h2>
            <p>Kenneth Lacovara discovered the Dreadnoughtus. He discovered the Dreadnoughtus in February in 2005. This was a massive discovery considering hw just found another dinosaur. Kenneth was so excited to have found a new species of dinosaur that nobody knows anything about. He did many exhibitions to find more of the bones so that he could do more research on the animal and get to know more things about it before anyone else.</p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Life History Cycle</h2>
            <p>They first begin their life in an egg and hatching out of the said egg. Once they are born they are susceptible to predators because they are still really small. But as they grow they are less susceptible to predators since they are getting bigger and aren’t very small anymore. Once they reach full grown they have no more predators at all since they are so big. Their full lifespan was 50 to 100 years and they became full size in roughly 20-30 years. So they still had many years to live after that.</p>

        <h2>Predators</h2>
        <p>The dreadnoughtus sisn't really have any 
            predators to note becauseof their size.But
             when they are first born and small they 
             are more susceptible to having predators
             to protect themselves from. The one
             other time they could have a predators
             was when they died. The only predators 
             they had then were theropods which were 
             smaller predators and scavenger dinosaurs.
             Those were the only few predators that the 
             Dreadnoughtus had in all of its life.
        </p>
        <h2>Habitats</h2>
        <p>Usually for the Dreadnoughtus But when
             they are first born and small they are 
             more susceptible to having predators to
             protect themselves from. The one other
             time they could have a predator was when
             they died. The only predators they had 
             then were theropods which were smaller
             predators and scavenger dinosaurs. 
             Those were the only few predators that
             the Dreadnoughtus had in all of its
             life.</p>
             <h2>Distribution</h2>
             <img src="images/42003_2020_1338_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="A map showing where the Dreadnoughtus is locatedwhen it lived.">
             <p>The Dreadnoughtus lived in mainly
                 South America before pangea split
                 up. The area in south america where
                 they lived was in Argentina. 
                 Argentina was filled with forests
                 and lakes which was a perfect
                 environment for Dreadnoughtus
                 dinosaurs. This was about the only
                 place known today that the 
                 Dreadnoughtus fossils have been 
                 found in.</p>
                 <h2>Feeding and Diet</h2>
                 <p>They ate all plants since they
                     were herbivores. And Because
                     they lived in forests and around
                     lakes they had all the food they
                     could eat there. Even Though they
                     all lived in herds they still had
                     plenty of food to go around. 
                     Since no other dinosaurs ever
                     challenged them for their food,
                     since they were so large and so
                     many of them. The plants that
                     these Dreadnoughtus usually 
                     lived off of were ferns, leaves,
                     and conifers. These were their 
                     main source of food since they
                     could reach really high with
                     their necks; nothing was off
                     limits to them.</p>
