           <h2>Fossil information</h2>
        <p>After four expeditions the entire 
         team had found about 145 bones and
         one singular tooth. These 145 bones
         included 112 from a bigger
         Dreadnoughtus and about 30 bones
         from a smaller second Dreadnoughtus.
         In all of those bones most of the
         vertebrae has been found which
         includes the tail, the neck, the
         scapula, multiple ribs, part of 
         the jaw, a couple toes, and a claw. The
         entire skeleton is only about 45.3% completed
         and that includes the skull.</p>
